# Kaggle House Prices
Exemplary solution to Kaggle's Data Science competition: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques.

This is a regression problem in which we forecast the prices of houses depending on certain information about them (such as size).

## Introduction

> Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

> With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
